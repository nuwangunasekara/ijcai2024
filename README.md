# Machine Learning for Streaming Data 
(IJCAI 2024 Tutorial)

Machine learning for data streams (MLDS) attempts to extract knowledge from a stream of non-IID data.
It has been a significant research area since the late 1990s, with increasing adoption in the industry over the past few years due to the emergence of Industry 4.0, where more industry processes are monitored online. Practitioners are presented with challenges such as detecting and adapting to concept drifts, continuously evolving models, and learning from partially labeled and unlabeled data.

Despite commendable efforts in open-source libraries, a gap persists between pioneering research and accessible tools, presenting challenges for practitioners, including experienced data scientists, in implementing and evaluating methods in this complex domain. Our tutorial addresses this gap with a dual focus. We discuss advanced research topics, such as partially delayed labeled streams, while providing practical demonstrations of their implementation and assessment using Python. By catering to both researchers and practitioners, this tutorial aims to empower users in designing, conducting experiments, and extending existing methodologies.

## Goals and Objectives
In this tutorial, our objective is to familiarize attendees with applying diverse machine-learning tasks to streaming data. Beyond an introductory overview, where we delineate the learning cycle of typical supervised learning tasks, we steer our focus towards pertinent challenges seldom addressed in conventional tutorials, such as: 

- **Prediction Intervals** for regression tasks
- **Concept drift** detection, visualization and evaluation
- Modelling and addressing **partially and delayed labeled data streams** using semi-supervised and active learning
- The idiosyncrasies of applying and evaluating **clustering** on a data stream

### Heitor Murilo Gomes
Heitor is a senior lecturer at the Victoria University of Wellington (VuW) in New Zealand. Before joining VuW, Heitor was a senior research fellow and co-director of the AI Institute at the University of Waikato were he taught from 2020 to 2022 the "data stream mining" (COMPX523) course. 
Heitor's main research area is the application of machine learning for data streams in a variety of tasks. 
In this field, he has contributed to ensemble learning for both regression and classification tasks, worked on unsupervised drift detection, and in 2023, he was awarded a grant to conduct research on developing novel theories and algorithms for partially delayed labeled streams.
Besides participating as PC member of a multitude of conferences (KDD, IJCAI, ECML, PAKDD, ...) Heitor is also an active contributor to open-source projects like MOA (Massive Online Analysis), StreamDM (a real-time analytics open-source software library built on top of Spark Streaming), and river (where he supervises students and postdocs since the inception of the project).
